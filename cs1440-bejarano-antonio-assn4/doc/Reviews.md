My first thought looking through the C++ Software development plan and UML class diagram is that C++ looks complicated, Iâ€™m sure that functions and methods make sense but trying to understand that everything means quickly is a bit more difficult to python where it is a lot more obvious what your code is trying to do. For the UML class diagram, once you understand the difference between C++ and python it becomes a bit clearer what their plan for the classes were. It is also very useful to see how each class should be interacting with each other and helps to design them similarly. Seeing all the inputs and outputs from each class really helps to understand how the design should work and where some classes could be broken up to make classes simpler. Reading through the software development plan was interesting because it gives me another perspective on the assignment, how other people might see the problems and how they plan to solve them, it is also nice just to have another software development plan to look at as an example. It almost seems like cheating with how much information, the documents give how each class should work so all there really is to convert their descriptions and ideas into code but obviously I need to put everything into my own words in a way that makes it clearer to me and will help me figure out how exactly the code should go.
