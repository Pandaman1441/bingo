|-------------|------------|--------------------
| October 25  | 2 hours    | Finished phase 0. Read through the instructions and tried to absorb as much of all the requirements as possible while I think about how the program will look like.
| October 25  | 1 hour     | I think phase 1 is about done, I'll check tomorrow but these analyses are getting easier, I'm realizing they aren't asking for much, phase 2 is where all the big thinking goes.
| October 26  | 1 hour     | Finished phase 1. cleaned up the SDP phases I've done and spent most of the time reading up on UML class diagrams in general and the UML class diagram and SDP from the C++ team.
| October 26  | 4 hours    | Creating the UML and writing the review and user manuel took me a bit, but writing up the pseudocode took the longest just trying to make sense of how the methods should work took me a while but i think i'm done with phase 2 going to take a break and check later.
| October 27  | 1 minute   | Finished phase 2. just gave it a quick look over and everything is there and removed the filler text.
| October 27  | 2 hours    | Started my implementation and nothing felt right so I went back and realized I didn't actually understand what I was trying to do with the UML class diagram.
| October 28  | 2 hours    | redid my UML and uploaded it and i've got the ui mostly functioning but i've got problems with print out a card.
